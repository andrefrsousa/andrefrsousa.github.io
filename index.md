# Hello 👋

I'm André Sousa, I was born in the city of Leiria, in 1990. I studied at the Polytechnic Institute of Leiria where I got my Bachelors degree in Computer Science and a Masters in Mobile Computing. 
Since 2012 I’ve been working on @WIT_Software as a senior android developer from #Leiria

In my spare time, I like to do code review and develop some android apps.
