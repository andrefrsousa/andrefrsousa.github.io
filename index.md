# Hello! 👋

I'm André Sousa, I was born in the city of Leiria, in 1990. I studied at the Polytechnic Institute of Leiria where I got my Bachelors degree in Computer Science and a Masters in Mobile Computing. Since 2012 I’ve been working on @WIT_Software as a senior android developer from #Leiria



In my spare time, I like to do code review and develop some android apps. 
When I’m not writing code, I’m usually travelling, taking photos, watching movies or singing in the shower.

Want to get in touch? Shoot me a tweet or an email.
