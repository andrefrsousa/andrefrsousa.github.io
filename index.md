# Hello! 👋

I'm André Sousa, I was born in the city of Leiria, in 1990. I studied at the Polytechnic Institute of Leiria where I got my Bachelors degree in Computer Science and a Masters in Mobile Computing. Since 2012 I’ve been working on [<span class="blue">@WIT_Software</span>](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FWIT_Software&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGvrLh_7lGUHtOvTw5r1g4arrodRw) as a senior android developer from [<span class="blue">#Leiria</span>](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Leiria/)

In my spare time, I like to do code review and develop some android apps. 
When I’m not writing code, I’m usually travelling, taking photos, watching movies or singing in the shower.
