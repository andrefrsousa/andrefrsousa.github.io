# Welcome to Privacy Policy! ðŸ‘‹

<br/>

The developer AndrÃ© Sousa respects the privacy of the users of its mobile applications, and this Privacy Policy is intended to describe the practices in the use of these applications. 

If you choose to use any of my applications, you consent to the collection and use of information in connection with this policy. The personal information I collect will be used to provide and improve the applications. I will not use or share your information with third parties except as described in this Privacy Policy.

The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meaning as in our terms and conditions, which are available at apps, unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.

<br/>

## Information Collection and Use
For a better experience when using our service, I may ask you to provide us with certain personal information. The information I request will be stored on your device and will not be collected by me in any way.
The App uses third-party services that may collect personally identifiable information.

## Cookies

Cookies are files with a small amount of data, which are often used as anonymous unique identifiers. They are sent to your browser from the websites you visit and stored in your device's internal memory.
This service does not explicitly use these "cookies". However, the application may use code from third parties and libraries that use "cookies" to collect information and improve their services. You have the ability to either accept or reject these cookies and know when a cookie is sent to your device. If you choose to decline our cookies, you may not be able to use some parts of this service.
<br/>

## Service provider

For the following reasons I can employ third party companies and individuals:
- To facilitate our service;
- To provide the service on our behalf;
- To provide service-related services; or
- To help us analyse the use of our service.

I would like to inform the users of this service that these third parties have access to your personal data. The reason for this is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obliged not to disclose the information or use it for other purposes.

<br/>

## Security
I appreciate your confidence in providing us with your personal information, which is why we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect it. But please remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure or reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.
<br/>

## Links to other sites
This service may contain links to other websites. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that website. Please note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore I strongly advise you to check the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and am not responsible for the content, privacy policies or practices of third party websites or services.
<br/>

## Privacy of children
These services are not intended for persons under 13 years of age. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If I discover that a child under the age of 13 has provided me with personally identifiable information, I will immediately delete it from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you know that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I can take the necessary steps.
<br/>

## Changes to this privacy policy
I will update Privacy Policy from time to time. We therefore recommend that you check this page regularly for changes. I will inform you about any changes by publishing the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes will take effect immediately after their publication on this page.
